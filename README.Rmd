# alligator

Experimental!

Delayed evaluation with tidyverse verbs, a bit like {dbplyr} but for local tables.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/alligator")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(tidyverse)
library(alligator)

al <-
  alligator(cars) |>
  mutate(a = speed * dist, b = speed /dist) |>
  filter(speed == 17)

# args are stored as quosures and we display their env in comments
al

# collect to eval
collect(al)
```
